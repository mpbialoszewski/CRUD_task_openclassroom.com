# CRUD_task_openclassroom.com
This is a task to create API with Node.js / MongoDB Atlas to the frontend provided by site openclassroom.com . This was my first ever created API 

## To run this you need 

Angular CLI for front-end

To install it globally type in NPM Command Line 

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

Once installed clone this repo 

git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/5614116-front-end-app.git frontend

Then within the folder 'frontend' run 

ng-serve 

Then in other terminal (or your IDE Terminal ) run this command in backend directory 

node server
