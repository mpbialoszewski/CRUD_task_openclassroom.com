# CRUD_task_openclassroom.com
This is a task to create API with Node.js / MongoDB Atlas to the frontend provided by site openclassroom.com . This was my first ever created API 

## To run this you need 


Angular CLI for front-end

To install it globally type in NPM Command Line 

`npm install -g @angular/cli`

## For front-end 

Create a new directory

Withing this new directory, clone this repo 

git clone https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/5614116-front-end-app.git frontend

Then within the folder 'frontend' run 

`ng-serve `

This will allow you to run the front-end application on desired port

## For back-end

Withing your directory create new directory called `backend`

Once within, in other terminal (or your IDE Terminal ) run this command in backend directory 

`node server`

If you want, you can also install `nodemon` through NPM packages and run 

`nodemon server`
